                    <p> This country's Founding Fathers such as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson intended for the United States Of America to become a place with “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” for every citizen and resident of this nation, while establishing a foundation for freedom and equal opportunity for all, regardless of their race, religion, gender, and sex. </p>

                    <p>According to an NPR article titled, “Why America’s Schools Have A Money Problem,” in 2013, the Chicago Ridge School District in Chicago spent $9,794 per child, while a school in Chicago’s affluent northern suburbs, Rondout School, spent $28,639 on each of its 145 students and 22 teachers. Urban schools such as those part of the Chicago Ridge School District suffer from diminishing resources such as teachers and classrooms, simply due to the fact that they cannot afford those extra things, whereas, in suburban schools such as Rondout School, every student has an “individualized learning plan” and also have teachers that are extremely qualified with “a decade of experience.” </p>
                   
                   <img class="npr" src="http://www.npr.org/news/graphics/2016/04/school-funding/map-us.png" width= "100%" height="100%">

                    <p> Dr. Linda Lemasters,  an associate professor at George Washington University, in her article, “Disparities Between Urban and Suburban Schools,” emphasizes the consequences of the funding disparities in urban schools when mentioning that they are prone to “inferior facilities, less adequate teachers, and an incomparable curriculum” (qtd in Wright) when compared to suburban schools with adequate funding (EFC.org). Due to studies like these and their findings, many Americans find the urban students culpable for their shortcomings, however they are unable to see that the failures of the students are the unfortunate consequences of an underdeveloped and underfunded educational system. </p>

                    <p> Since almost 30% of urban students are likely to be living in poverty than a mere 13% of suburban students, according to a study conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics, urban students were more likely to attend schools with higher concentrations of low income students. Due to the the fact that a majority of urban high school students seem to come from imperfect households, student morale and expectations such as doing homework and participating in after school activities start diminishing, ultimately hindering the growth that the students could demonstrate if they had access to the the right resources and environment.</p>

                    <p> Other than raising awareness to frequent racial stereotyping and providing teens of color with a platform to share and comprehend such experiences, it is also our goal to provide those underpriveleged teens of Chicago's urban, underdevloped public schools with the resources and support that priveleged, suburban students have always had access to. </p>
